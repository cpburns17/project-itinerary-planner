    prompt = f"Help me create a detailed itinerary for my upcoming vacation. I’m going to share with you my travel details along with what I’m interested in doing/seeing, and to make it easier I’ve broken my interests up into 4 categories: Food, Entertainment, Nightlife, and Culture. Make sure the itinerary contains things to do from each category, and include the day of the week. I’m visiting Paris, France during these dates: 06/07/2024 through 06/11/2024 with about 4 of my closest family & friends. We arrive at 7:30am and depart the last day at 5:00pm local time. Food: For each day of my trip, find me breakfast and dinner options  that are moderately priced for the following types of cuisines: french, pasta, seafood. Don’t forget to provide names of restaurants/cafes for each day. Also, provide one point as to why you chose this restaurant/cafe. Entertainment: Please provide me with a few options for local entertainment that include: see a play, and tour a museum. Include where I can buy tickets if necessary. Nightlife: We also want to experience some nightlife activities, so find us a few popular bars and clubs. Share a quick blurb as to why you chose these places. Culture: Lastly, please include some places of cultural or historical significance such as the Louvre, the Eiffel tower, and world war 2 sites that we can visit. Include details for buying tickets if they're required and any tips on best times to go to avoid crowds. Please feel free to make any recommendations at the end of your response!"
